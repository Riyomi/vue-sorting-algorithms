## Vue Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction
Inspired by VisuAlgo, the app aims to help beginners understand sorting algorithms by visualizing them. Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, count sort and radix sort are available as of now.

## Features
* Visualize seven popular and commonly taught sorting algorithms
* Randomly generate array
* Change input array manually
* Change animation speed

## Used technologies
* Vue
* HTML
* CSS

## Future improvements
* **Add animations**: although the current implementation does a good job at visualizing the algorithms, adding some animations such as when swapping and moving elements would make the app more appalling.
* **Improve design**: the current design of the website can come off as plain due to the somehow dull color palette and simple geometric shapes.
* **Graph algorithms**: the app could be extended so that it would cover graph algorithms as well.
