# Vue Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Introduction
Inspired by VisuAlgo, this app aims to help beginner programmers understand sorting algorithms better by visualizing what steps each algorithm takes to sort the input array. The app currently offers visualization of four sorting algorithms (bubble, insertion, selection and merge sort) and is still under development.
